A simulation for Cerenkov light production in LXe

Geant 4 should be installed as per this tutorial:
http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/SLACTutorial14/HandsOn1/

To Do List:
Please write your name beside the project you are currently working on so we can keep track of who's doing what.
Do not push changes that will break or weaken functionality for anyone else. If you would like to upload these changes then please create a fork.
LOTS!
- The physics list is basically untouched an we need to look at that. - (Eric Woolsey is working on this)
- NEST needs to be integrated.
- Geaometry needs to be re looked at. It is very basic and needs to be a little more sophisticated.
- Figure out how to make sure the sensitive volumes are actually logging hits.
- Set up a way to save relevent simulation data to a root file so it can be viewed.

Feel free to write anything here that you think is relevant.
